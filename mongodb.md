I found a database product that has different data model with we've learned, which is called MongoDB, the website is https://www.mongodb.com/. The data model of it is document-oriented. Which is different with we've learned is that the document data model is a way of organizing and storing data in a non-relational database. In this model, data is stored in a hierarchical, document-like structure, such as JSON or XML, rather than in tables with rows and columns like a relational database. Each document contains one or more fields, each of which has a name and a value.
