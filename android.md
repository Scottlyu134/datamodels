I found a database product called Android Operating System, and the website is https://developer.android.com/. It's an open-source database software system. The data model of it is SQLite. As to the hosting model, Android supports a variety of hosting models for applications, including local and cloud-based hosting, depending on the app's requirements and the user's preferences. Java and Python can both access the Android operating system through the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provided by the Android platform.
