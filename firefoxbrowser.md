The first database product is Firefox Web Browser. The website is https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/ I think it should be an open-source software application, because users are free to modify the code to suit their own needs. The data model of Firefox Web Browser is SQLite. The hosting model of Firefox Web Browser is local, because the application is executed locally. As to the way that Java or Python access to it, I think one way is through the use of browser automation tools like Selenium, also it can be used in adds-on or extensions.
