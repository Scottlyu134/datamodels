I found a database product called Dropbox Cloud Storage, its website is https://www.dropbox.com/. The Dropbox Cloud Storage is a commercial storage system. The data model of it is SQLite. Dropbox Cloud Storage's hosting model is cloud-based. Java and Python can access Dropbox Cloud Storage through the Dropbox API, which provides a set of HTTP endpoints that can be used to upload, download, and manage files on Dropbox.
